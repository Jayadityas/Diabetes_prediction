# Diabetes_prediction
Overview

This project aims to improve the accuracy of diabetes prediction using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization, we build a robust predictive system that assists in early diagnosis and risk assessment.

Features

1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and outlier detection.

2. Feature Engineering: Selecting the most relevant features to enhance model performance.

3. Machine Learning Models: Implementing and comparing various classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

4. Evaluation Metrics: Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to assess model effectiveness.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters for better predictive performance.
